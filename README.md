### This is Simple Express Starter Kit

#### Node express + Typescript + Prisma ORM REST api 

You can use it for your project. If it is useful for you,  
don't forget to give me a **GitHub star**, please.

In this node/express template

   - Express framework 
   - Typescript
   - DB - MySQL or PostgreSQL
   - Prisma ORM
   - REST api 
   - JWT auth
   - bcrypt
   - express-validator 
   - error handler etc.

In order to use it,

Create a .env file and add this.  
For MySQL

```
DATABASE_URL="mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/mydb"
TOKEN_SECRET="something hard to guess"

```

For PostgreSQL

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
TOKEN_SECRET="something hard to guess"

```
Please note.   
*TOKEN_SECRET* should be complex and hard to guess.  
After git clone, it should be run.

```
npm install
npm run dev

```
